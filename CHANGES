nhocr-0.22.tar.gz : (Aug. 29, 2014)

  * Some code fixes have been made.

  * A part of the image manipulation library O2-tools has been
    included in the source tree.

  * Vertical writing has been supported. However, the accompanying
    dictionaries in this release lack vertical fonts, especially in 
    symbols. Many characters are compatible and could be recognized
    well also in vertical documents.

    The dictionaries with vertical fonts will be available in future
    releases.

  * Language post-processing support has been added.
    (Server "gramd" by Tomasz Mikolajewski is required to

    This feature is experimental, and some side effects may exist.
    See also README-gramd.

  * Minor bug-fixes.
